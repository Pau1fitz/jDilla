                    <p>"James Dewitt Yancey, better known by the stage names J
                    Dilla and Jay Dee, was an American record producer who
                    emerged from the mid-1990s underground hip-hop scene in
                    Detroit, Michigan. According to his obituary at NPR.org, he
                    was one of the music industry's most influential hip-hop
                    artists, working for big-name acts including A Tribe Called
                    Quest, De La Soul, Busta Rhymes, The Pharcyde and Common.
                    Yancey died in 2006 of the blood disease Thrombotic
                    thrombocytopenic purpura."</p>
